# UCVibe 🎓

UCVibe is a full-stack web app that allows University of California students to rate and review campus resources like dining halls, lecture halls, and recreation centers.

Built for students, by a student to help others make smarter decisions about not only where to eat, study, and attend class but to hopefully improve campus facilities.
